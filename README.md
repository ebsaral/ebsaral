# Hey! ðŸ‘‹ 

## A _funnywise_ human with engineering, thinking and artistic skills. 

I'm an engineering manager deeply committed to addressing and solving the root causes of social injustice and environmental challenges.  
At this point of my life, I'm more eager to redirect my career toward a more meaningful and impactful purpose.

You can view my resume for politics to have a detailed look at how to solve environmental challenges via understanding nature's principles. Here are a few example topics I've began to share recently:
- The root causes of illness and how we can prevent all diseases by aligning with natural principles.
- The need for a fair and nature-informed approach to education that nurtures every individualâ€™s true potential.
- How we develop our abilities and talents â€” both consciously and unconsciously â€” and the ways we influence one anotherâ€™s growth.
- The nature of luck: how it arises, how itâ€™s shaped by our environments, and how we can help unlock it universally.
- How our behavoirs shape climate change and how to prevent natural disasters.
- What the future of nature â€”and our place within itâ€” will look like.

I am now looking to join a like-minded organization where I can contribute, grow, and collaborate to create a positive change globally.

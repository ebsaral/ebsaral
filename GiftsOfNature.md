# Some Natural Gifts that I've earned ðŸ¤˜ðŸ§¿ðŸ§¿ðŸ¤˜
Years of life experience with [a lot of challenges and rewards](https://medium.com/@ebsaral/challenges-levels-rewards-and-punishments-in-nature-7b31286e20ae) to pursue my journey better.

## Healthy Mind and Body
A **priceless** balance, beyond money, rooted in ancient wisdom. In simple words: **I don't get sick** and **I can't be poisoned**.

## Harmonizing with Nature
I feel music and some natural movements deeply **before they begin** â€” like dancing with destiny through invisible threads. So **nothing is a *coincidence*** anymore.

## Rapid Learning
I **quickly master** new topics and skills with little effort once focused.

## Timeless Empathy
I **sense the *spirits*** of those from the past or future (mostly unconsciously), channeling their presence in my expressions. I can do empathy with anyone **directly or indirectly**.

## Cumulative Energy & Creative Inspiration
I feel **the life force** of others around me. This allows me to dance or move for hours and possibly uplift and inspire their spirits. Sensing othersâ€™ thoughts and emotions, I **blend** them to spark fresh, creative ideas and solutions.

## Water as a Life Source & Protection
Water transforms to **meet nature's needs** thus mine, driven by choices of living beings. And, any damage caused in and around my life willingly **goes back to the responsibles** much stronger within nature.

*... and happy to share (more) with everyone since these are the proofs of **being one** and it belongs to nature.* :)

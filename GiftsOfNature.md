# Some Natural Gifts that I've earned
Years of life experience with [a lot of challenges and rewards](https://medium.com/@ebsaral/challenges-levels-rewards-and-punishments-in-nature-7b31286e20ae) to pursue my journey better.

## Healthy Mind and Body
A **priceless** balance, beyond money, rooted in ancient wisdom.

## Harmonizing with Nature
I feel music and some movements deeply **before they begin** — like dancing with destiny through invisible threads.

## Rapid Learning
I **quickly master** new topics with little effort once focused.

## Creative Inspiration
Sensing others’ thoughts and emotions, I **blend** them to spark fresh, creative ideas.

## Cumulative Energy
I feel **the life force** of others around me. This allows me to dance or move for hours and possibly uplift and inspire their spirits.

## Water as a Life Source
Water transforms to **meet nature's needs** thus mine, driven by choices of living beings.

## Timeless Empathy
I **sense the *spirits*** of those from the past or future (unconsciously), channeling their presence in my expressions. This is a proof of ***being one***.

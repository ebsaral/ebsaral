# Some Natural Gifts I've earned

Years of life experience with [a lot of challenges and rewards](https://medium.com/@ebsaral/challenges-levels-rewards-and-punishments-in-nature-7b31286e20ae) to pursue my journey better.

## Water as a Life Source & Protection
Water transforms to **meet nature's needs** thus mine, driven by choices of living beings. And, any damage caused in and around my life willingly **goes back to the responsibles** much stronger within nature. This way I can reach my goals without worrying about possible roadblocks.  


## Harmonizing with Nature
I feel some natural movements along with their sounds deeply **before they begin** — like dancing with destiny through invisible threads. So **nothing is a *coincidence*** anymore. This enables me to have **a great vision in any topic**.  

Some natural movements: Weather conditions, earthquakes, crashes, natural disasters, the movements of people (and animals), any object's movement, any pressure on any object, etc...  

Object movement examples: 
- I can feel what another person feels in their body; how much it hurts and where it hurts.
- I can feel the tension on a car's parts; where it requires a repair and how serious it is. 
- Any decision being taken anywhere, even if they are taken behind closed doors or in the middle of nowhere. This only works if I'm allowed to know something. So, I don't (and can't) know everything.
- When I'm in traffic, I can feel what other drivers are about to do — like signaling or turning. Then I know if I should adjust my speed or make a turn. I can also sense when a pedestrian is about to cross or when the road ahead is clear enough to speed up. I can also navigate to any desired location without the need of current technology but it usually makes my route longer.  

*Sometimes I feel movements days before they happen due to the lack of having good exceptions in certain environments. I mostly don't focus on a lot of movements.*

## Timeless Empathy
I **sense the *spirits*** of those from the past or future (mostly unconsciously), channeling their presence in my expressions. I can do empathy with anyone **directly** or **indirectly**.  

**Example:** When I speak on a random subject or move within an unrelated context, my spirit may begin to reflect the person you're thinking about. My body language might even shift to mirror their familiar behaviors. Though I'm mostly aware of it as it happens, I also know deep down that your thoughts are with someone else. Sometimes I may guess who that person is, and this is mostly fun.

*Doing empathy with someone doesn't necessarily mean that I agree with their actions, yet everybody is free to choose their actions in nature.*

## Cumulative Energy & Creative Inspiration
I feel **the life force** of others around me in both near and far distance. This allows me to dance or move for hours and possibly uplift and inspire their spirits. Sensing other living beings, I **blend** their spirits to spark fresh, creative ideas and solutions for all problems within nature's guidance. In every movement or speech I make, you have a chance to learn something about yourself or your environment.  

As a master puppet in the world of puppets, I enable other people to get better: I simply **inspire everyone's being** by introducing new (existing) perspectives into their mindsets with my experienced empathy talent and knowledge. The details make every life more meaningful.  

*My talents and knowledge also get inspired by people around me. So I give what I learn from them **back to nature's being in a multi-directional education cycle**.*

## Rapid Learning
I **quickly master** new topics and skills with little effort once focused. I feel motivated and move better in an environment where I can pursue my interests and goals within mutual respect and trust.

## Healthy Mind and Body
A **priceless** balance, beyond money, rooted in ancient wisdom. In simple words: **I don't get sick** and **I can't be poisoned**.  

Any possible harmful action towards me gets a warning or blocking from nature's being until there is no threat anymore.  

**Example:**
- If somebody is going or planning to harm me, their body cells attack them first in the form of a warning. Every harm caused against me turns into a protection. If I am not dead, I become much stronger.

**Hey!**  I know these all sound **magical** *(and maybe a bit scary)* to you while it's not a surprise for me anymore. If you would like to witness the validity of my gifts, **feel free to try me** with honesty and goodwill.  

*Facing these gifts by thinking "this can't be true" is not a scientific approach. Because it is true, darling. :)*  

Remember, **you also have all these gifts** visibly hidden in your journey. So, testing my gifts (talents) instead of trying (seeing) them might possibly deceive your own intention(s), and that choice isn’t mine to make.

> [!NOTE]  
> There's no psychological or scientific trick behind my actions. I simply move or try to move. I don't have any intention to harm anyone.    

> [!WARNING] 
> A friendly reminder: Your actions (every choice you make) will be rewarded or punished by your own body cells.  

> [!CAUTION]
> Every living being is subject to the subtle influence of nature — an unstoppable force beyond the reach of any known intelligence. Nature already knows the entirety of who you are, just as you instinctively sense it does. Any misuse of power for harmful intent will inevitably lead to consequences, unfolding slowly but surely over time.  

> [!TIP]
> Obstructing any being from fulfilling nature's purpose will inevitably lead to harmful consequences. That's why you must not ignore your responsibility — regardless of your title, occupation, or reputation.

I'm happy to share these gifts and more with **everyone** because these are the proofs of **being one**, so it all belongs to nature. :)

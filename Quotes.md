My quotes followed by equality and freedom in nature: `|0.t| ≈ 1 where t = ∞`


### "Be a bug of your world until there is no exception to ruin its code."

Pseudocode:

```javascript
let value = Infinity
let self = undefined

while(true) {
    try {
        if(!self) {
            self = me(value)
        }
        self.refresh()
    }
    catch (e) {
        console.error(e)
        self.reset(e)   
    }
    finally {
        self.update()
    }
}
```


### "A power is not a gift until it's used for good."

Money, as an example, is a temporary power since it can't buy health.

### "The best revenge is to be a better person than any enemy. Then there is neither revenge nor enemy."

An enemy is not necessarily a person; it can also be a bad experience.

### "Your worth is not defined by others in the scale of growing together."

It takes guts to admit failure(s) and learn from them. Being humble enough to learn from mistakes is an essential item for your growth circle. 

### "Those who left without an absolute need for becoming one was right."

A multi-dimensional thinking on `|0.t| ≈ 1, where t = ∞`: Explanation of universe spread over time as being a single organism divided in different parts as wholes. 0 is an absorbing element and t is time spent in evolution. Every time frame spent far away from reaching infinity resets itself to zero…

### "You are also born to be right but you are politically corrected."

I don't even know when we lost our touch with nature thus each other. Let's focus on future as much as we can.

### "Time only passes to move our responsibility further."

The universe's time is frozen at infinity since its beginning. So nature doesn't die but loops in itself. We, mostly humans, have a sense of time because we are mortals under nature's guidance.

My quotes followed by equality and freedom in nature: `|0.t| ≈ 1 where t = ∞`


### "Human must learn their animality before calling themselves human being truly."

It's crucial to understand animality in humans to build a civilization on top of nature's being. 

### "A power is not a gift until it's used for good."

Money, as an example, is a temporary power since it can't buy health.

### "The best revenge is to be a better person than any enemy. Then there is neither revenge nor enemy."

An enemy is not necessarily a person; it can also be a bad experience. Returning no harm when it's done to you is a good approach to get better. It's harder to do empathy when you feel helpless because you must be patient. You must realize that you are not alone.

### "Your worth is not defined by others in the scale of growing together."

It takes guts to admit failure(s) and learn from them. Being humble enough to learn from mistakes is an essential item for your growth circle. 

### "Those who left without an absolute need for becoming one was right."

A multi-dimensional thinking on `|0.t| ≈ 1, where t = ∞`: Explanation of universe spread over time as being a single organism divided in different parts as wholes. 0 is an absorbing element and t is time spent in evolution. Every time frame spent far away from reaching infinity resets itself to zero…

### "You are also born to be right but you are politically corrected."

I don't even know when we lost our touch with nature thus each other. Let's focus on future as much as we can.

### "Time only passes to move our responsibility further."

The universe's time is frozen at infinity since its beginning. So nature doesn't die but loops in itself. We, mostly humans, have a sense of time because we are mortals under nature's guidance. 

### "Democracy is only an illusion if kingdoms are distributed over different companies."  

We heard about revolutions, industrializations and democracy in our common histories. We have never seen their capitals being shared among citizens equally. Democracy has never actually existed so far.

### "Time becomes more valuable when it's shared."  

At the moment, we value ourselves by selling our time instead of sharing it. This attitude in economy disconnects people from each other and it shortens everyone's lifetime indirectly. Because people unwillingly struggle from roadblocks in current structure. We undirectly kill each other because we don't understand nature's reality deeply.

### "We don't belong to anyone or anywhere; we just try to get along on this chaotic sphere."

We should redefine ourselves to find our common path to infinity. Then we can follow bigger problems easier in peace. 

### "Be a bug of your world until there is no exception to ruin its code."

Pseudocode:

```javascript
let value = Infinity
let self = undefined

while(true) {
    try {
        if(!self) {
            self = me(value)
        }
        self.refresh()
    }
    catch (e) {
        console.error(e)
        self.reset(e)   
    }
    finally {
        self.update()
    }
}
```
